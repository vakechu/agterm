  create, rename, close, select, or reorder sessions and workspaces; split panes; toggle the
  per-session scratch terminal; open or close overlay terminals and read their exit status; display
  an image inline via a bundled helper script; type
  into a session, copy its selection, or search its scrollback; post desktop notifications; manage windows (new, list,
  select, close, resize, move); change font size; or reload and edit the keymap. Also covers the
  window/workspace/session addressing model and the AGTERM_* environment a spawned shell sees, plus
  diagnosing problems (keymap editor, custom actions, logs) and filing a bug as a GitHub issue or a
  feature request / question as a GitHub Discussion.

# Driving agterm

agterm is a native macOS terminal. It exposes a programmatic control channel over a local unix
socket, driven by the companion CLI `agtermctl`. Use it to build and steer terminal layouts, run
programs in overlays, type into sessions, and notify the user in the exact session you are working
in. Fire-and-forget commands only: there is no terminal-output streaming and no event subscription.

## Am I inside agterm?

Each shell agterm spawns gets these environment variables. Check `AGTERM_ENABLED` before assuming
the control channel is available:

- `AGTERM_ENABLED=1` — this shell runs inside agterm.
- `AGTERM_SESSION_ID` — the current session's UUID (the session this shell belongs to).
- `AGTERM_WINDOW_ID` / `AGTERM_WORKSPACE_ID` — the owning window / workspace UUIDs.
- `AGTERM_SOCKET` — the absolute path to the control socket this app bound.

The quick terminal is scratch (not in the tree), so it only gets `AGTERM_ENABLED`, `AGTERM_WINDOW_ID`,
and `AGTERM_SOCKET` (no session/workspace ids).

## Running agtermctl

`agtermctl` must be on PATH (install it from agterm's **Help ▸ Install Command Line Tool…**). If it
is not on PATH, the user can install it, or you invoke it by absolute path.

- The socket path auto-resolves; usually no `--socket` is needed. To be explicit, pass
  `--socket "$AGTERM_SOCKET"`.
- `--socket` and other options go **after** the subcommand: `agtermctl tree --json`, not
  `agtermctl --json tree`.
- Add `--json` to any command to get the raw JSON response (machine-readable). Without it, mutations
  print `ok` and `tree`/`list` print a human listing.
- One request per invocation. Mutating commands return the affected/new id; create commands
  (`session new`, `workspace new`, `window new`) print the new id.

## The model

A **window** is the top level: a named bundle rendered in its own on-screen macOS window. Each window
holds a tree of **workspaces**, each holding **sessions**. A session has a primary shell and can also
have: a **split** pane (a second shell side by side), a **scratch** terminal (a third full-coverage
shell, toggled like the split), and an ephemeral **overlay** (runs one program on top, then vanishes).
Separately, each window has one **quick terminal** (a scratch overlay at 90% of the window, not part
of the tree).

Inspect the live tree any time with `agtermctl tree --json` (workspaces → sessions, each with
`id`, `name`, `cwd`, `active`, `split`, `overlay`, `scratch`). List windows with
`agtermctl window list --json`.

## Addressing

Commands that target a session or workspace take `--target` (default `active`):

- `active` — the selected session / current workspace.
- a full UUID (case-insensitive), or a unique **prefix** of one (git-style). Zero matches → `notFound`
  error; two or more → `ambiguous` error listing candidates.

`window.*` commands take the window id/prefix/`active` as a positional argument. Other commands accept
a global `--window <id|prefix|active>` to operate on a specific window's tree (default: the frontmost).

Scripts rarely type ids: create with `*.new` (capture the returned id), or act on `active`.

## Command summary (44 commands)

Run `agtermctl <area> <cmd> --help` for exact flags. Full detail in **reference.md**; recipes in
**examples.md**.

**tree** — print the workspace/session tree (`--json` for structured).

**workspace** — `new [name]` · `rename <name>` · `delete` · `select` · `move --to up|down|top|bottom` ·
`focus [on|off|toggle]` (collapse the sidebar tree to a single workspace).

**session**
- `new [--cwd DIR] [--workspace W] [--command CMD]` — create (and focus) a session; `--command` runs
  that program as the session process instead of a login shell.
- `close` · `select` · `rename <name>`.
- `go --to next|prev|first|last|next-attention|prev-attention` — move the selection between sessions.
- `move <workspace>` (relocate) or `move --to up|down|top|bottom` (reorder within the workspace).
- `type <text> [--stdin] [--select]` — inject keystrokes (real typing, Enter included).
- `copy` — print the session's selected text (does NOT touch the system clipboard).
- `search [needle] [--next|--prev|--close]` — search the terminal scrollback; prints the "N of M" counter.
- `split [on|off|toggle]` — side-by-side second shell (hide keeps it alive).
- `scratch [on|off|toggle]` — full-coverage third shell (hide keeps it alive; `exit` recreates).
- `focus [left|right|other]` — move focus between split panes.
- `status <idle|active|completed|blocked> [--blink] [--auto-reset]` — set the sidebar agent glyph.
- `flag [on|off|toggle|clear]` — flag a session for the flagged working-set view (`clear` unflags all).
- `overlay open <command> [--cwd DIR] [--wait] [--block] [--size-percent N]` · `overlay close` ·
  `overlay result` — run a program on top of a session; `--block` waits and exits with its status. An
  overlay is a real terminal (pty), which is also how you **display an image inline** — via the bundled
  `scripts/show-image.sh` (see below).

**window** — `new [name]` · `list` · `select <id>` · `close <id>` · `rename <id> <name>` ·
`delete <id>` · `resize <id> --width W --height H` · `move <id> --x X --y Y [--display N]`.

**quick** — `[show|hide|toggle]` — the window's quick terminal.

**sidebar** — `[show|hide|toggle]` (visibility) · `mode [tree|flagged|toggle]` (flip between the
workspace tree and the flat flagged working-set list) · `expand [--window W]` (expand every workspace) ·
`collapse [--window W]` (collapse all workspaces except the active one, which stays expanded).
Visibility/mode act on the frontmost window; `expand`/`collapse` default to the frontmost but take a
`--window` selector to target any open window.

**notify** — `notify <body> [--title T]` — post a desktop notification attributed to a session.

**font** — `font inc|dec|reset` — font size on the focused surface.

**keymap** — `keymap reload` — re-read `keymap.conf` (prints the parse-diagnostic count).

**theme** — `theme list` (bundled themes, current marked `*`) · `theme set [name]` — set + persist the
terminal theme app-wide. The app default is the bundled **agterm** theme; omit the name for ghostty's
built-in default ("default ghostty"); an unknown name errors.

## Displaying an image inline

This skill bundles `scripts/show-image.sh`. It opens an overlay (a real terminal) and renders the
image there via the kitty graphics protocol, which ghostty draws natively — no kitty binary and no
external image tool, just `base64` + `printf`. Run it with the image path (optional size percent,
default 60):

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/agterm/scripts/show-image.sh <image> [size-percent]   # Claude Code
bash ~/.codex/skills/agterm/scripts/show-image.sh <image> [size-percent]    # Codex
```

Do NOT print graphics escapes to your own tool stdout (the agent harness escapes the control bytes)
and do NOT run an image viewer in your tool shell (no controlling terminal). The overlay is what makes
it render. Outside agterm (`AGTERM_ENABLED` unset) there is no overlay — fall back to `open <image>`.

## Troubleshooting and reporting

When the user hits a problem (a keymap editor that will not open, a custom action that does nothing,
notifications missing), diagnose it from inside the session first: inspect `agtermctl tree --json`,
run `agtermctl keymap reload` for the parse-diagnostic count, and read the unified logs under
subsystem `com.umputun.agterm`. If it turns out to be a bug, offer to help file it.

**Filing is opt-in and draft-first.** Never run a `gh` command without the user's explicit approval.
Decide first whether it is a bug (a supported feature misbehaving → a GitHub **issue**) or something
not supported / a question / an idea (→ a GitHub **Discussion**, category `Ideas` or `Q&A`). Draft the
title and body, show it to the user, scrub anything private (tokens, hostnames, usernames in paths,
selection/clipboard text), and only post after an explicit go-ahead. If `gh` is missing or not
authenticated, hand the user the prefilled text plus the new-issue / new-discussion URL instead.

Full detail, templates, and the exact `gh` commands are in **troubleshooting.md**.

## Reference files

- **examples.md** — copy-paste agtermctl recipes for common tasks (build a layout, run a program in a
  blocking overlay and read its status, type into a fresh session, notify, inspect the tree).
- **troubleshooting.md** — diagnosing common problems (keymap editor, custom actions, logs) and the
  bug-issue / feature-Discussion reporting workflow (draft-first, scrub, never post without approval).
- **scripts/show-image.sh** — bundled helper that displays an image inline in an overlay (see above).

Read those files when you need exact flags, return shapes, or worked examples.
