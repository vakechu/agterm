# Troubleshooting agterm and reporting problems

Two jobs: (1) diagnose a problem from inside an agterm session, (2) help the user file it on the repo
as a bug (issue) or a feature/question (Discussion) — safely, never posting without approval.

The full user-facing version of the diagnostics below is the repo's `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

## Diagnosing from inside a session

You are inside agterm (`AGTERM_ENABLED=1`). Use:

- **Live state** — `agtermctl tree --json`, `agtermctl window list --json`.
- **Keymap problems** — `agtermctl keymap reload` prints the parse-diagnostic count (`0` = clean). A
  non-zero count means `keymap.conf` has problems; the user sees the list in Settings ▸ Key Mapping.
- **Logs** (unified logging, subsystem `com.umputun.agterm`):
  ```bash
  log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"' --info --last 30m
  ```
  Categories: `CustomCommandRunner`, `SettingsModel`, `GhosttyApp`, `NotificationManager`, `ControlServer`.
- **Files** — keymap `~/.config/agterm/keymap.conf`; settings
  `~/Library/Application Support/agterm/settings.json`; socket path in `$AGTERM_SOCKET`.

### "Keymap editor won't open"

Edit Keymap runs `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` (else `vi`) in an overlay via the login shell. The most common
cause is a **GUI editor launched without a blocking flag** (`code`, `subl`, `zed`, `mate`, `cursor`):
it returns immediately, so the overlay flashes shut. Fix: `export EDITOR='code -w'` (the editor's wait
flag) in the shell rc. It also no-ops with no session selected or an overlay already open.

### "Custom action does nothing"

Causes, in order: a parse error (see the diagnostics); the chord conflicts with a built-in or another
custom command and was dropped to palette-only (it still runs from `⌃⇧P`, tagged `custom`); a reserved
chord (`ctrl+tab`, `ctrl+1`/`ctrl+2`); a modifier-less key (rejected — a custom chord needs a
modifier); it only fires while a terminal pane has keyboard focus; it runs in a non-interactive
`/bin/sh -c` (no aliases/functions, a smaller `PATH` — use absolute paths or `$SHELL -lc '…'`); a
non-zero exit posts a failure banner (meaning it DID fire and failed). Reload after edits:
`agtermctl keymap reload`.

## Reporting: decide bug vs unsupported FIRST

- A **supported** thing misbehaves (a documented command/feature does the wrong thing, a crash, a parse
  bug) → a GitHub **issue**.
- The user wants something **not supported**, or it is a question / idea / "can it do X" → a GitHub
  **Discussion** (category `Ideas` for a feature request, `Q&A` for a question). Do NOT file a feature
  request as a bug.

## Hard rules for filing

1. **Never run any `gh` command without the user's explicit approval in this conversation.** Drafting
   is fine; posting needs a clear go-ahead ("post it").
2. **Check tooling first** — `gh auth status`. If `gh` is missing or not logged in, do NOT install or
   authenticate it. Give the user the prefilled content plus the URL to paste it into:
   - issue: <https://github.com/umputun/agterm/issues/new>
   - discussion: <https://github.com/umputun/agterm/discussions/new>
3. **Draft first.** Show the user the full title and body, and get explicit approval before any `gh`.
4. **Scrub sensitive content** before showing or posting: API tokens/keys, passwords, internal
   hostnames/IPs, usernames embedded in absolute paths (replace with `~` or `<user>`), private repo
   names, and the contents of a selection / `session.copy` / clipboard. When unsure, ask.
5. **Gather the repro facts yourself** where you can: agterm version (the user reads it from
   agterm ▸ About agterm), `agtermctl tree --json` shape, a scrubbed `keymap.conf` excerpt, a scrubbed
   `log show` excerpt.

## Issue template (bug)

```
Title: <short, specific>

What happened: <one or two sentences>
Expected vs actual: <…>
Steps to reproduce:
1. …
2. …
Environment: agterm <version>, macOS <version>
Logs: <scrubbed `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.umputun.agterm"'` excerpt>
Config: <scrubbed keymap.conf lines, if keymap-related>
```

File it (only after approval) with `--body-file -` so a multi-line body is not mangled by quoting:

```bash
gh issue create -R umputun/agterm --title "<title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
```

## Discussion (feature request / question)

```bash
gh discussion create -R umputun/agterm --category "Ideas" --title "<title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
<body>
EOF
```

Use `--category "Ideas"` for a feature request, `"Q&A"` for a question. Same draft-first, scrub, and
explicit-approval rules apply.
