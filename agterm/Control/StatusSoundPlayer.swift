/// `NSSound(named:)`, which also resolves custom sounds in `~/Library/Sounds`. `play(_:)` resolves AND
/// plays, but de-bounces a replay of the same sound within a short window (`SoundThrottle`) so a burst of
/// rapid status sets can't machine-gun an identical clip.

/// reloading and to avoid the AppKit gotcha where a locally-scoped `NSSound` is deallocated mid-play and
