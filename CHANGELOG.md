# Changelog

## v0.13.0 - 2026-07-14

### New Features

- title-bar recent-sessions clock and attention bell, each opening a popover to jump to a recent or waiting session when the sidebar is hidden #212 @umputun
- opt-in Dock-icon bounce on a background notification, off by default, with a None / Once / Until focused picker in Settings ▸ Notifications #215 @umputun
- agent-status glyphs on dashboard cells, so a session that needs attention stands out in the grid #209 @umputun
- `$AGT_PANE` now reports which pane a custom command fired from (`left` / `right` / `scratch`), so a keybinding can route a follow-up `agtermctl` call back into that pane #210 @umputun

### Bug Fixes

- resolve a session's agent-status pane from a stable surface token, keeping the status glyph and pane-aware reveal correct across split and scratch teardown #213 @umputun
- apply libghostty mouse cursor shapes via `cursorUpdate`, so the pointer shape tracks what the terminal program requests #207 @umputun

## v0.12.1 - 2026-07-13

### Bug Fixes

- stop agterm's embedded shells from identifying as Ghostty via `TERM_PROGRAM`, which could make a Ghostty-aware tool shell out to a standalone `ghostty` on the `PATH` and launch a windowless Ghostty.app while you were using agterm #203 @umputun
- fix the Codex agent status getting stuck on `blocked` during an auto review, where the permission prompt fired before the review resolved it #204 @umputun
- strip the dashboard's titlebar to a single exit button while the grid is open, so its sidebar, split, scratch, and quick-terminal buttons can no longer steal focus and leave Esc unable to close the grid #205 @umputun

## v0.12.0 - 2026-07-12

### New Features

- dashboard grid overlay: a per-window grid that shows a picked set of live terminal panes at once, so you can glance across several sessions and jump into one. `⌘⇧D` toggles it over the window's most-recently-used sessions, `agtermctl dashboard <id> <id> ...` opens it over an explicit set, up to nine cells and view-only (arrows move the highlight, Enter drops in, Esc closes) #202 @umputun
- sidebar Finder folder drops create sessions rooted at the dropped directories, plus `Reveal in Finder` for the active session and spring-open of collapsed workspaces while dragging over them #180 @melonamin
- promote the surviving split pane into the main slot when the primary pane's shell exits, so a collapsed-to-single session behaves like a fresh single pane, reports `left`, and a later `session.split` opens a fresh pane beside it #121 @fkirill
- drive Codex agent-status from its lifecycle hooks instead of keyword-matching the final message, so an approval prompt shows `blocked` the moment Codex asks and an ordinary turn no longer gets wrongly stuck on it #194 @umputun

### Bug Fixes

- stop split panes flickering on a rapid focus change, where two overlapping focus retry loops ping-ponged first responder between the panes for ~400ms #200 @umputun

## v0.11.0 - 2026-07-11

### New Features

- multi-select sessions in the sidebar to batch close, move, flag/unflag, or clear status, and drag selected groups between workspaces #179 @melonamin
- terminal zoom: `cmd+shift+return` renders the active surface full-window over the sidebar and chrome, also driveable over the control API with `surface.zoom` / `agtermctl surface zoom` #158 @melonamin
- Edit menu Copy/Paste/Select All now work when the terminal has focus, with `session.paste` and `session.selectall` added to the control API #181 @umputun
- configurable sidebar font size in Settings > Appearance > Window #187 @umputun

### Improvements

- drop the "Closed <name> / Reopen" toast; the undo window is unchanged (cmd-Z during the grace period, File > Reopen Last Closed Item after) cf43d5f @umputun

### Bug Fixes

- re-tint sidebar row text from the row view's live selection state so multi-selected rows stay legible #189 @melonamin
- let `agtermctl font` target a split or scratch pane #188 @umputun
- clear the active agent-status glyph on Ctrl-C, not just Escape #185 @umputun
- keep workspace and session ids unique across close, undo, and reopen #184 @umputun
- keep keyboard focus on the overlay/scratch, not the pane behind it #182 @umputun

## v0.10.2 - 2026-07-08

### Bug Fixes

- restore a saved window onto a connected display so one left on a now-disconnected external monitor no longer reopens off-screen #178 @melonamin
- hide a leftover titlebar decoration band that showed over the terminal in hidden toolbar mode df81d56 @umputun

## v0.10.1 - 2026-07-08

### Improvements

- type into the quick terminal and read its screen back over the control API with `quick type` / `quick text` #177 @umputun
- soften the sidebar workspace name to a medium weight so it reads a touch heavier than the sessions without the heavy bold f793fd3 @umputun

## v0.10.0 - 2026-07-08

### New Features

- hidden toolbar mode - a full-bleed terminal with no titlebar row and no traffic-light buttons #173 @umputun
- reopen recently closed sessions #174 @melonamin
- follow the macOS light/dark appearance automatically via ghostty's dual theme value #74 @paul-nameless
- read-back for the focused split pane, status blink/color, and quick-terminal visibility over the control API #169 @umputun
- read-back for split ratio, window geometry, workspace focus, sidebar mode, and window fullscreen/zoom over the control API #168 @umputun
- expose an open overlay's size on the tree read side #167 @umputun

### Improvements

### Improvements

- session.seen control command to clear a session's unseen-notification badge headlessly, without opening it #156 @umputun

- show the chrome hairlines on light themes #150 @umputun
- the selected-session label is now readable on light themes #146 @bigspawn

## v0.8.2 - 2026-07-05

### Bug Fixes

- microphone access for command-line tools running inside agterm now works: a hardened-runtime app also needs the audio-input entitlement, not just the usage description added in v0.8.1 @umputun

## v0.8.1 - 2026-07-05

### Bug Fixes

- declare a microphone usage description so command-line tools running inside an agterm terminal can request microphone access #143 @umputun

## v0.8.0 - 2026-07-05

### New Features

- place a new session directly after or before another with session new --after/--before (and session move), instead of walking it up with repeated moves #134 @olomix

- link the About panel to agterm.com instead of the GitHub repo @umputun

## v0.7.1 - 2026-07-04

### Improvements

- pointing-hand cursor on ⌘-hover over a link, with ⌘-click opening validated web and mail links #125 @vnazarenko
